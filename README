DESCRIPTION :
ZZplayer is a MPEG-I video player for the KDE environement.
He is based on SMPEG library. You can play video in loop, with double size or
without audio.



SMPEG is a free MPEG1 video player library with sound support.  Video playback
is based on the ubiquitous Berkeley MPEG player, mpeg_play v2.2.  Audio is
played through a slightly modified mpegsound library, part of Splay v0.8.2.
SMPEG supports MPEG audio (MP3), MPEG-1 video, and MPEG system streams.
This library is distributed under the GNU Library Public License (LGPL)
version 2.


Known Issues:

	The MPEG decoding is a fairly slow and mathematically intensive
	process.  It could use even further optimization.

	There isn't any synchronization between the audio and video threads,
	and system stream timestamps are ignored.  The video is synchronized
	with audio by using video framerate and elapsed time.  They are
	are synchronized well enough for short clips, but long movies, or
	movies with visual audio cues (like speech) don't look very good.


Requirements:

	* Simple DirectMedia Layer v0.10.2 or newer

	* Qt 1.44 is needed for ZZplayer
