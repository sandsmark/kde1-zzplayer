I'm testing the fullscreen mode.<BR>
Use full-screen mode at you own risks!<BR>
<BR>
Fullscreen STILL may have a few bugs.  If it bugs out, you may not have
any working control over your system aside from telneting in and sysrq..
Use at your own risk, it uses root privs also, so be careful and review the
source if you are scared.<BR>
<BR>
Also on fullscreen:<BR>
The way fullscreen mode works is by asking the X-server for the smallest
available resolution that is bigger than the mpeg it has in it's config and
using that, the display will not be fullscreen if you do not have sufficiently
small modes available. These modes may be dangerous to your configuration, be
careful and edit them to whatever you wish.  They CAN damage hardware not
designed to take it.<BR>
<BR>
Usually, it is a good idea to make sure that the following
resolutions are defined in your XFree86 configuration file
(XF86Config):<BR>
<BR>
   Mode "320x240"<BR>
    DotClock   15.750<BR>
    HTimings   320 336 384 400<BR>
    VTimings   240 244 246 262<BR>
     Flags        "Doublescan"<BR>
   EndMode<BR>
<BR>
   Mode "352x240"<BR>
    DotClock   15.750<BR>
    HTimings   352 368 416 432<BR>
    VTimings   240 244 246 262<BR>
     Flags        "Doublescan"<BR>
   EndMode<BR>
<BR>
   Mode "352x280"<BR>
    DotClock   15.750<BR>
    HTimings   352 368 416 432<BR>
    VTimings   280 288 286 302<BR>
     Flags        "Doublescan"<BR>
   EndMode<BR>
<BR>
   Mode "352x288"<BR>
    DotClock   15.750<BR>
    HTimings   352 368 416 432<BR>
    VTimings   288 296 290 310<BR>
     Flags        "Doublescan"<BR>
   EndMode<BR>
<BR>
Don't forget to add all those modes in the Modes line for each<BR>
Display subsection of the Screen section.
<BR>
Note: The timing indicated here may be inadequate for your graphic
board and/or monitor.  Please refer to the XFree86 Howto, FAQ and
documentation for configuring XFree86 and setting video modes:<BR>

<BR>
It is good idea to use "xvidtune" to finetune the video modes
you are planning to use for the fullscreen video playback.<BR>
SDL currently relies on XFree86's DGA extension, therefore
full-screen will only work with XFree86, not with other X servers
like XiG's Accelerated-X.<BR>
<BR>
Full-screen only works on a local display.  Because of a
limitation in the DGA of XFree86 3.2, it won't work with DISPLAY
set to "localhost:0.0", even though this is the local display.
Environment variable DISPLAY should be set to ":0.0".<BR>
To check: $ printenv DISPLAY<BR>
The full-screen mode will use the closest XFree86 mode that matches
or is larger than the size of the video.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
XFree86 must run in 16, 24 or 32-bit depth.<BR>
<BR>
Current limitations & Known problems<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Full-screen mode is currently not available in 8-bit depth.<BR>
<BR>
Full-screen mode may not look good if the video size is not
a multiple of 16.<BR>
<BR>
To enter full-screen mode use the button Fullscreen.<BR>
<BR>
To exit full-screen mode and return to normal display mode, press any key or click the mouse.<BR>
